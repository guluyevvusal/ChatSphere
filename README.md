This project is focused on building a real-time chat application and will work with full DevOps automation using SignalR, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, Azure/AWS, CI/CD. Here I present a detailed plan for building and testing each component sequentially, you can see below.



📌 Technologies and Architecture



.NET Core / ASP.NET Core Web API – Core technology for Backend

ASP.NET Core SignalR – For real-time messaging

Entity Framework Core + SQL Server – Database and ORM

Redis – For caching and fast data transfer

Identity & JWT – User authentication and authorization




📌 DevOps and Cloud Technologies:

Docker & Kubernetes – Containerization and scaling

Azure / AWS – Cloud hosting and deployment

GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps – CI/CD pipeline automation

Serilog + ELK Stack – Logging and monitoring



📌 API Modules

1. Authentication & User Management

User registration, login, and authentication with JWT

Storing and updating user data

2. Chat Rooms & Messaging

Creating and managing chat rooms

Connecting users to different chat rooms

Sending and storing messages in real-time

3. SignalR Hub & Real-Time Connections

Live messaging using SignalR

4. Redis & Performance Optimization

Caching messages with Redis

Caching strategies to improve API performance




📌 CI/CD and Deployment

Docker & Kubernetes

Containerization with Dockerfile

Managing multiple services with docker-compose.yml

Horizontal scalability with Kubernetes

Azure / AWS Deployment

Automatic deployment with Azure App Service or AWS ECS/EKS

Performance optimization with Azure Redis Cache or AWS ElastiCache

CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps)

Fully automated pipeline consisting of Build, Test and Deploy stages

Unit and Integration Tests will be run automatically




🚀 Launching the Project

1. Starting Dependent Services

docker-compose up -d

2. Launching the Backend API

dotnet run --project ChatSphere.API




🛠 Future Updates
